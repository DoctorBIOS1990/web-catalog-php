# :handbag: Web Catalog Imperio GAMERS

I was asked to develop this catalog for a local Wi-Fi network, to connect clients, and at the same time be compatible with the same SQLite database of the offline catalogs.
The founder of the business is the main worker, he updates the databases, local and a remote one that has several users via LAN, to gain publicity.

He lacks the staff to dedicate himself to work on the databases in the cloud, and the possibility of hiring them.
